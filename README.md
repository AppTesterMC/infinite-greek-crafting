## A little project I did for fun.
It is ready to be run in any browser "Developper Tools" console and is compatible with Infinite Craft Helper recipes and Pinned. Just needs a discord WebHook if you like the recipes to be stored in a discord channel. By default It will try to save a JSON file in every loop of a newly discovered recipe, optionally you could disable it. It only stores, logs only elements with valid English or Greek words, chacked against neurolingo.gr project api. USE RESPONSIBLY.
